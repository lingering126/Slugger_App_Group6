# Slugger_App_Group6
## Project Description:
**To improve the mental and physical health, as well as the overall happiness, by creating inclusive, purpose-driven communities where individuals can contribute meaningfully, regardless of their circumstances or background (S1)**
Slugger is a lifestyle app designed to enhance physical and mental health while fostering a sense of community and shared accountability. Through setting weekly personal and group targets, tracking progress, and incorporating peer responsibility, Slugger helps users build lasting, positive habits for a balanced and fulfilling life.
Key Features:

1. Customised Goals: Users define weekly personal targets across three domains: physical health (e.g., running, yoga, or rehabilitation), mental wellness (e.g., journaling, meditation, learning a skill), and long-term aspirations.
2. Community and Peer Responsibility: Join or create communities that work together toward combined weekly targets. Success is celebrated with group-designed positive reinforcements, while unmet goals lead to fun, motivational challenges that reinforce shared responsibility.
3. Activity Tracking with Rewards: Earn points for physical and mental activities, with bonus points awarded for contributing to community goals, family involvement, personal bests, and progress toward long-term objectives.
4. Holistic Approach to Wellness: Encourage a well-rounded lifestyle by integrating physical, mental, and social dimensions into a cohesive tracking system that reflects your growth in every area.
5. Gamified Motivation: Community-designed incentives and playful consequences keep progress engaging and foster a supportive network where everyone is accountable for one another’s success.
